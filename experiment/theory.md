## CORE LOGGING-Engineering Geological Investigations
Core logging is the systematic recording and measuring of as much information as possible/required to determine the lithology (rock types), mineralogy, potential geological history, structure and alteration zones through a tiny piece of cylindrical rock drilled and removed from a potential mineral deposit.
Considered the primary method of determining grade, size and mineability of a potential mineral deposit drill cores are relied on by exploration and mining companies around the world.

General acceptance of such a guide ensures that core logs will generally contain meaningful descriptions of the rock mass parameters most significant in rock engineering problems. The use of defined terms and format ensures that any reader of the log will have an appreciation of the original appearance of the core, and in particular those aspects important to rock engineering. The proposed guide takes due cognizance of existing accepted systems of soil and rock mass description or classification and attempts to remain compatible with these wherever feasible. Only those parameters which are commonly of interest in rock engineering are described. Qualitative descriptions depending only on visual inspection and simple mechanical field tests are used. Primary core descriptions include descriptions of colour, weathering, fabric, discontinuity surface spacing, hardness, rock name and stratigraphic horizon. This is followed, where required, by a description of the discontinuity surfaces including their type, separation, fracture filling (presence or absence), roughness and orientation. If significant an additional description of the nature of the fracture filling including moisture, colour, consistency or hardness, soil or rock type and origin is added. The significance of each of these parameters with respect to engineering behaviour is discussed and standard descriptive terms defined.
## Preliminary Introduction to ROCK MECHANICS 
Rock structure rating (RSR) by Wickham considered two elements influencing on rock mass behavior: geological parameters and construction parameters. 
Rock mass rating (RMR) by Bieniawski  also known as Geomechanics classification utilizes the basic parameters regarding the geometry and mechanical conditions of the rock mass. Q-system  is product of rock mass geometry, interblock shear strength and active stresses encountered during underground excavations. The RMR system was proposed by Bieniawski is  based on various case histories to recognize the stability and support requirements of tunnels.

 The RMR system has a wide variety of applications in different engineering projects like tunnels, foundations, slopes and mines.
##### There are six parameters for RMR system:
· Uniaxial Compressive Strength of rock materials (UCS)
· Rock quality designation (RQD)
· Spacing of discontinuities
· Conditions of discontinuities
· Orientation of discontinuities
· Ground water conditions

##### Q=RQD/Jn×Jr/Ja×Jw/SRF
##### The parameters are:
##### RQD = Rock Quality Designation
##### Jn = Joint set number
##### Jr = Joint roughness number
##### Ja = Joint alteration number
##### Jw = Joint water reduction number
##### SRF = Stress Reduction Factor

RMR system classifies strata along tunnel alignment into several zones, each with more or less similar geological features. In most of the circumstances, boundary of these structural regions will overlap with the main geological features such as shear zones, faults and dykes etc. The Q-system consists of six parameters to calculate Q values by using equation given below and Q values classify the rock mass into poor and good quality to estimate the required support.

RMR is determined as an algebraic sum of ratings for all of the parameters. On the basis of RMR values for a given engineering structure, the rock mass is sorted into five classes: very good (RMR 100–81), good (80–61), fair (60–41), poor (40–21), and very poor (<20).
Although the rating methods of RMR and Q-system are additive and multiplicative, respectively, the basic concepts of both schemes are similar. Both schemes allocate the ratings to the properties that influence the rock mass behavior and then quantitative figures such as total-RMR and Q-value are produced.
Rock-quality designation (RQD) is a rough measure of the degree of jointing or fracture in a rock mass, measured as a percentage of the drill core in lengths of 10 cm or more. High-quality rock has an RQD of more than 75%, low quality of less than 50%. Rock quality designation (RQD) has several definitions.

## UNIQUENESS OF ROCK SPECIMENS AT COEP IN GEOLOGY MUSUEM.

A review of the existing knowledge on the Deccan Volcanic Province of India shows that it has a significant geographic bias towards the western parts, while the rest of the province is not as well constrained. Emerging data on its structure, geochronology and volcanology in the last decade suggests that many existing concepts and models of this large Continental Flood Basalt Province are open to revisions or replacement. The explicit relation between the Deccan volcanism and the Reunion hotspot makes it a unique laboratory for studying magmatic evolution over active hotspots, its upward trajectory through a thick continental crust and the mode and mechanics of eruption and spread of large volumes of lava on continental settings.
The great activity of Magmatic Eruption in this Deccan Traps have given rise to variations of textures in Igneous Petrology and the Geology Museum Of COEP has preserved through the last many decades; the specimens of full textural variations  of Igneous Rocks . Also these were very much exposed in the Natural Museum of the Second Railway line cutting of Famous BORGAHT on the Mumbai Pune Central Railway near the Monkey point LONAVALA.
The Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP) is one of the remarkable geo-events in the geologic history of the Indian
plate that holds a prominent position in global tectonic models, particularly in the context of the assembly and
break-up of southern Gondwanan landmasses, uplift of continental landmasses, magma generation in the deep
mantle, climate change and biotic evolution. Hence the importance and uniqueness.

Apart from these there are numerous UNIQUE SPECIMENS in lab like a originally formed Quartz  flower ;many rare metallic minerals and a considerable collection of all varieties of ZEOLITES of Deccan Traps and fossils.
